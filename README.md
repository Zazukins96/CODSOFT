### Data Science Projects at CodSoft
This repository showcases the data science projects I worked on during my internship at CodSoft. These projects highlight my experience in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

### Project List
1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Objective: Predict the survival of passengers based on features like age, gender, and ticket class.
Key Skills: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn.

2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Objective: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions while addressing dataset imbalance.
Key Skills: Handling imbalanced datasets (SMOTE), feature engineering, and model optimization.
Tools: Python, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

3. Movie Rating Prediction with Python
Objective: Predict movie ratings based on various input features like genre, runtime, budget, and cast.
Key Skills: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling.
Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### Key Learnings

During my internship at CodSoft,

* Learned to implement end-to-end data science workflows for predictive modeling.
* Gained experience in addressing real-world challenges such as data imbalance and feature engineering.
* Applied machine learning algorithms to solve business problems in multiple domains.
